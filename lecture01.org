* What is formal verification?
- A technique providing means of increasing assurance for the correctness of systems
  by proving their correctness with respect to a certain formal specification, using formal methods of mathematics
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
- In other words: it is the application of deductive proof to programs or to hardware designs
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
- Formal ~ having a syntax and may be given semantics
* Components of formal verification
- Specification
- Implementation
- Formal proof
- Checker
# one constructs a mathematical representation of the actual program or
# hardware design, then one could prove deductively that the program or
# design was a correct implementation of its specification.
* Formal specification
- A faithful mathematical representation of what a program or hardware design was intended to do
- Specifying systems is hard and is a form of art!
* Formal proof
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
- A formal proof is a proof in which every logical inference has been checked all the way back to the fundamental axioms (A definition by T.C. Hales)
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
- All the intermediate logical steps are supplied, without exception
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
- No appeal is made to intuition, even if the translation from intuition to logic is routine
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
- A formal proof is less intuitive, and yet less susceptible to logical errors
* Why is verification important?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
- Ensure systems are bug-free
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
  + Therac-25
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
  + Ariane 5 Disaster, Mars Climate Orbiter, Mariner 1, Patriot missile
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
  + The Pentium bug
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
  + The DAO Attack
  + ...
* Why is verification important?
- Gain an insight about the system at hand
* The proof is not absolute
- A verified system is not "correct" or "dependable" in some absolute sense
- The specification might not capture what was required for safety, security, etc.
- An actual computer system might not behave in accordance with even the most detailed mathematical model of it
* Using computers to do proofs
- Formal verification is proof _about_ computers
- Closely related, but distinct, is the _use_ of computers in proof.
- Proofs about computer systems are usually highly intricate but not conceptually deep
* There is lots of formal systems
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
- Not all formalizms are created equal
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
- E.g. to expand the definition of the number =1= fully in terms of Bourbaki primitives requires over _4 trillion symbols_
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
- With formal proofs one wants as much help as one can get
* Formal methods techniques
The land of formal methods includes
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
- Interactive theorem provers (e.g. Coq)
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
- Automated theorem provers (SAT/SMT solvers, ...)
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
- Specification languages & Model checking
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
- Program Logics
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in

* What is Coq?
Coq is a formal proof management system.
It provides
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
- a language to write mathematical definitions,
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
- executable algorithms,
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
- theorems (specifications),
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
- environment for interactive development of machine-checked proofs.
* Related systems
- Lean prover (similar to Coq)
- F* (used to verify crypto code in Firefox)
- Isabelle/HOL (simple type theory, seL4)
- Agda (predicative)
- Idris (similar to Agda)
* Why Coq?
- Expressive
- Industrial adoption
- Mature and battle-tested
- Lots of books and tutorials
- Lots of libraries
- Excellent community
* What do people use Coq for?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
- Formalization of mathematics:
  + Four color theorem
  + Feit-Thompson theorem
  + Homotopy type theory
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
- Education: it's a proof _assistant_.

* Successes of Verified Software
- "[T]he under-development version of CompCert is the only compiler we have tested for which Csmith cannot find wrong-code errors. This is not for lack of trying: we have devoted about six CPU-years to the task."
Yang et al., PLDI '11
* Successes of Verified Software
- "... none of these bugs were found in the distributed protocols of verified systems, despite that we specifically searched for protocol bugs and spent more than eight months in this process."
Fonseca et al., EuroSys '17

* Bugs in verified systems
- "Using Csmith, we found previously unknown bugs in unproved parts of CompCert—bugs that cause this compiler to silently produce incorrect code."
Yang et al., PLDI '11
* Bugs in verified systems
- "Surprisingly, we have found 16 bugs in the verified systems that have a negative impact on the server correctness or on the verification guarantees."
Fonseca et al., EuroSys '17
* Proofs _and_ Tests
- =@vj_chidambaram=: Even verified file systems have unverified parts :)
- FSCQ had a buggy optimization in the Haskell-C bindings
- CompCert is known to also have bugs in the non-verified parts, invalid axioms and "out of verification scope" bugs

* What is Coq based on?
_*Calculus of Inductive Constructions*_

Just some keywords:
- Higher-order constructivist logic
- Dependent types (expressivity!)
- Curry-Howard Correspondence
* Curry-Howard Correspondence
- Main idea:
  + propositions are special case of types
  + a proof is a program of the required type
- One language to rule 'em all
- Proof checking = Type checking!
- Proving = Programming

* Proving _is_ programming
- High confidence in your code
- It is as strong as strong your specs are (trust!)
- It can be extremely hard to come up with a spec (think of browsers)
- IMHO: the best kind of programming
* Coq as Programming Language
- Functional
- Dependently-typed
- *Total* language
